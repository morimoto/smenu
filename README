* How to use kmenu ?

	You need to specify the device to watch for events. If no other
	options are given, all key up/down events will be displayed:

	> kmenu /dev/input/event0
	event scanning
	----------------
	Event: type 1 (EV_KEY), code 2 (KEY_1), value 1
	Event: type 0 (EV_SYN), code 0 (EV_SYN), value 0
	----------------
	Event: type 1 (EV_KEY), code 2 (KEY_1), value 0
	Event: type 0 (EV_SYN), code 0 (EV_SYN), value 0
	...

	For example, to print "hallo world" when KEY_1 is pressed:

	> kmenu /dev/input/event0 2 1 "echo hallo world"

	where 2 is the code for KEY_1, and 1 means "pressed".

	The following will exit kmenu when KEY_3 is pressed:

	> kmenu /dev/input/event0 4 1 0

	The following will retrieve one of two key codes into a variable:

	> KEY=`kmenu /dev/input/event0 -e 21 1 "echo y;false" 49 1 "echo n;false"`

	Note that kmenu (and tmenu) will stop scanning for events if the -e
	option is given and the script that's run returns a non-zero exit code.

* How to use tmenu ?

	You need to specify the device to watch for events. If no other
	options are given, the screen status will be monitored:

	> tmenu /dev/input/event1
	event scanning
	----------------
	Event: type 3 (EV_ABS), code 0 (ABS_X), value 2592
	Event: type 3 (EV_ABS), code 24 (ABS_PRESSURE), value 168
	Event: type 0 (EV_SYN), code 0 (EV_SYN), value 0
	----------------
	Event: type 3 (EV_ABS), code 0 (ABS_X), value 2489
	Event: type 3 (EV_ABS), code 1 (ABS_Y), value 1712
	....

	For example, to print "hallo world" when a press occurs within a
	region of size 1000 around the point x = 1500, y = 1500:

	> tmenu /dev/input/event1 1500 1500 1000 "echo hallo world"

	The following will exit tmenu when such a press occurs:

	> tmenu /dev/input/event1 1500 1500 1000 0
